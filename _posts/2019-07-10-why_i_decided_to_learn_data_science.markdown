For many years I have aspired to learn computer programming. I tried teaching myself web development, but for some reason it didn’t have that “spark”. Later on I took classes in my local community college on computer science. This interested me but it was a very broad field and some things were just boring and I thought I would never end up using them. Later on I reconsidered teaching myself to code and started browsing coding boot camps. I was young and naive so I didn’t really know what I was looking for. I found boot camps in all sorts of tech fields. I did some research and saw what these different fields were all about. There are three main things that attracted me to data science: learning high level math, developing artificial intelligence, and getting a job with higher pay.

I have always found math fun because it is a form of logical problem solving. Artificial intelligence captivates my curiosity, I ask myself “How much could this technology change the world?”. Finally, the pay is a big motivation for me, I wish to pursue my financial freedom.
And so there I was on my journey to become a data scientist. Along the way there were many things that captured me and let me know that I had made the right choice. Something about using machine learning to solve problems that, in the past were incapable of being solved. I also got to embrace my artistic side by creating colorful visualizations of data using countless methods. Everything seemed to happen for a reason and I’m grateful to be where I am.
