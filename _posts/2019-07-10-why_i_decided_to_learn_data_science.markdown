     For many years I have aspired to learn computer programming. I tried learning web development, but for some reason it didn't have that "spark". There are three main things that attracted me to data science: learning high level math, developing artificial intelligence, and getting a job with higher pay. 
		 
		 I have always found math fun because it is a form of logical problem solving. Artificial intelligence captivates my curiosity, I ask myself "How much could this technology change the world?". Finally, the pay is a big motivation for me, I wish to pursue my financial freedom.
